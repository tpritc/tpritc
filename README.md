**Hey, I'm Tom**. Nice to meet you! ✨

I love designing and building software that people actually want to use.

I'm the CTO at [Details](https://orthodonticdetails.com), where we're massively improving the work-lives of clinical staff at orthodontic practices. [Want to join our team?](mailto:tom@orthodonticdetails.com)

Here are some of the cool projects I've worked on over the last few years:
- 👩‍🎓 Before Details I was the co-founder and CTO Tandem Labs. There, I designed and built University Assistant, which enabled students to reach out and ask their university for help right from their phone. It had a massive impact on student retention, especially among students who were the first in their families to go to university. We sold Tandem Labs and University Assistant in 2020.
- 💾 I created [Identifiable](https://github.com/tpritc/identifiable), a quick-and-easy way to add unique, random public-facing identifiers for records in your Ruby-on-Rails applications.
- 🔑 I created [Verboten Keys](https://github.com/tpritc/verboten_keys), a last of defense to help prevent you and your team from accidentally leaking private information via your Rails and Sinatra APIs.

You can find me on Twitter as [@tpritc](https://twitter.com/tpritc) and on Mastodon at [@tpritc@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@tpritc)! Say hi!

I use [he/him pronouns](https://pronoun.is/he).
