**Hey, I'm Tom**. Nice to meet you! ✨ I'm a software engineering consultant, focusing on large, enterprise Ruby on Rails codebases. Do you have an interesting problem on your mind? [Let me know!](mailto:hi@tpritc.com)

Here are some of the cool projects I've worked on recently:
- 👩‍🎓 I co-founded Tandem Labs in May 2017, and built [University Assistant](https://asktandem.com), a tool for universities to reach out and meet their students where they are. We sold Tandem Labs and University Assistant in March 2020.
- 💾 I created [Identifiable](https://github.com/tpritc/identifiable), a quick-and-easy way to add unique, random publc-facing identifiers for records in your Ruby on Rails applications.
- 🔑 I created [Verboten Keys](https://github.com/tpritc/verboten_keys), a last of defense to help prevent you and your team from accidentally leaking private information via your Rails and Sinatra APIs.

You can find me on Twitter as [@tpritc](https://twitter.com/tpritc)! Say hi!
