**Hey, I'm Tom**. Nice to meet you! ✨ I'm a software engineering consultant, focusing on large, enterprise Ruby on Rails codebases. Do you have an interesting problem on your mind? [Let me know!](mailto:hi@tpritc.com)

Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently:
- 👩‍🎓 I co-founded Tandem Labs in May 2017, and built [University Assistant](https://asktandem.com), a tool for universities to reach out and meet their students where they are. We sold Tandem Labs and University Assistant in March 2020.
- 🎙 I made [Podcast Chapters](https://chaptersapp.com), a Mac app for podcast creators. It got great reviews, with [MacStories saying it made adding chapter markers to podcasts "a breeze"](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/chapters-makes-quick-work-of-adding-chapter-markers-to-podcasts/), and [MacWorld called it a "gem"](https://www.macworld.com/article/3025951/chapters-review-mac-app-adds-segment-marks-to-mp3-podcasts-and-audio-files.html).
- 👾 I made [Colourise](https://store.steampowered.com/app/576820/Colourise/), a VR puzzle game that forces you to think spatially. Reviewers called it "sublime".
